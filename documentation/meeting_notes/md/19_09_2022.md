## Feedback regarding proposed pipeline

- technical level at this point hard to evaluate in detail, but presentation was forwarded to multiple AI experts -> results/feedback pending, probabily this week
- but most requirements held up until now are met

\--> Text accuracy has to be as best as possible without overfitting (model should still generalize)

\--> Processing locally is great, matches philosophy of data ownership followed by Translue

Long term vision:

Translator application is the first step in the field of efficient computer vision

\- self-determined usability, ability to reflect one's own user behavior

\- share data based on own values, negotiate the price

- \--> Translator is the first step to get there

## Tasks

Establish development milestones

\- Propose them in a ticket

- \- Development: Building components on the computer first to focus on functionality rather than restrictions; this should result in a proof of concept that later could be "boiled down" and optimized for phone application
- Await pipeline proposal feedback
- Take first development steps
