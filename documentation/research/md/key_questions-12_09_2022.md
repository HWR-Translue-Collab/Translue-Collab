Please help us analyze the following direct competitors from the following perspective:

Important [Info: Please communicate before you decide on which app](about:blank) you are going to investigate.

Each person should have a different app to investigate.

1.  Function list: what are the main functions they are offering
2.  Technology list: what kind of tech they are using-including translations APIs, OCR APIs and other technology in the product
3.  User flow: a clear flow chart showing exactly how the app works from logic perspective
4.  Further information: Anything you found in the app that might be useful but not mentioned in the first 3 points.
5.  You thought: after analyzing the app, what do you think are the biggest problems? How would you like to improve them/make them different?(based on the idea of Translue)

Note: If you find a better competitor, you can analyze what you found.

The purpose of this task is to help us understand our competitors better and have a structured overview of the similar products. With the information I mentioned above, we will need less time to build a product by ourselves.

All the competitors listed here ⬇️ are Android based, if you use iPhone, please pick one of the competitors with this link ➡️. [competitos, open source](./competitors-open_source.md)
