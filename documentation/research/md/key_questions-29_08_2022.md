# Key Questions: 29.08.2022

1.  How can we detect Word Elements properly? Current Options: Use API, develop on our own AI. Any Idea?
2.  What kind of Text detection APIs are there on the market?

**What are the alternatives to Vision AI (Google)?**

An analysis list on this topic, with open-source ones and commercial ones

1.  Problem with Vision AI (Google)

    1.  Bad Text recognition

    Q: How to build our own Text Recognition AI?

    What do we have to consider theoretically?

    What kinds of pre-defined models exist?

    What kind of data do we need to train it better?

2.  What technology can we use to stabilize the layer on an identified element?

(What kind of tracking technology) It is like AR filter on face with the feeling of

1.  Identifying
2.  Stabilizing
